## üß™ About RadiumOS

RadiumOS is an experimental hobby operating system project created for learning and educational purposes. This is a work-in-progress OS kernel that demonstrates basic operating system concepts and low-level programming.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This is a hobby project with many limitations and bugs. It is NOT intended for production use or as a replacement for any existing operating system.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Learn operating system development fundamentals
- Understand low-level hardware interaction
- Explore kernel programming concepts
- Practice systems programming in C
- Build a basic bootable kernel

## üîß Current Features

- [x] Basic bootloader
- [x] Simple kernel initialization
- [x] Basic memory management (limited)
- [x] Simple text output
- [x] Keyboard driver
- [ ] File system support
- [x] Process management
- [ ] Network stack (Not Yet)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

- **Memory Management**: Very basic, prone to leaks and corruption
- **Hardware Support**: Limited to specific configurations
- **Stability**: Frequent crashes and undefined behavior
- **Security**: No security features implemented
- **Performance**: Not optimized, educational code only
- **Compatibility**: May not work on all hardware
- **Documentation**: Incomplete and sparse
